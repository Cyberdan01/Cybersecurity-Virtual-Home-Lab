<h1>Cybersecurity Virtual Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a walkthrough setting up my cybersecurity home lab, which includes Kali Linux, Metasploitable, Ubuntu Server (Wazuh), Ubuntu Desktop, and Flare VM. This home lab was designed as a controlled environment to explore real-world cybersecurity scenarios, simulate attacks and defenses, and analyze network behavior. VMware Workstation was used as the virtualization platform to host a set of virtual machines (VMs) commonly used in penetration testing, malware analysis, threat detection, and system hardening.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>VMware Workstation</b> (21H2)
- <b>Purpose: Practical learning, testing, and simulation of offensive and defensive security techniques.</b> (21H2)
